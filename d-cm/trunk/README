-Nautilus:
	- goto /home/username/DCM
	- doubleclick on dcm
	- choose run

Features

-File Manager
	The file Manager has 2 parts
	the left part is to navigate trough your directories, by doubleclicking the selected file will appear in the right window
	or if it is a folder (indicated with [F]) it will display the folder contents on the left.
	the right part is to control a file. You can rename the file, open the file with its default program (DOPEN needed), ...
-MySql
	This tab, is to control your Databases.  (DCM currently only supports MySql databases)
	After specifying your host,user and password in the configuration window (DCM->Options->Mysql) and starting mysql (MySql->Start)
	you will see on the left a list with all your tables and on the right, a box to enter queries, and an output box
-Deditor
	This is a basic editor which can do simple tasks and upload it's content to the web trough ftp.
-Ftp
	This works the same way as the file manager except it shows a ftp dir.
-Dcmd
	This is a program that is only available from terminal.
	the possible commands:
	dcmd -s		simply returns: 'DCM is running' or 'DCM is not running'
	dcmd -e		returns the ammount of rules in DOPEN/extlib.de
	*futur commands:
	dcmd -m		mysql default on/off
	dcmd -f		ftp default on/off
	dcmd -v		DCM version
	dcmd -u		Update/Upgrade DCM with curl + tar
-Derminal
	This will be a futur project to integrate a terminal system in DCM
