Prerequisites

You need at least 2 things to run D-CM well:
-Python (2.6 or later)	http://www.python.org/download/linux/
-wxPython			http://www.wxpython.org/download.php

Modules used in D-CM:

Directory Tree

-DCM
->DOPEN			special folder for dopen
-->extlib.ded			returns a command based on the extension (*)
-->extlibman			Extlib Manager, used to change the extlib.ded file with a GUI
-->dwnext.ded		Temporary save from the newest extlib.ded
->Deditor			special folder for deditor
-->configuration.ded	configuration file for deditor
->dcm				main program
->dcmlog.ded			the log file, if there appears an error you have to check this line
->CHANGELOG		the changelog
->README			this file
->config.ded			the configuration file
->dcmd				a command line file (**)
->dcmsvn			a command line file utility for svn actions
->ftp.ded			a file for handling ftp (***)
->deditor.py			standalone version of deditor

(*)	this command will be directly used in terminal followed by the filename.
(**)	this file has handy options like returning the status, giving the ammount of rules in exlib,...
(***)	it's a copy of the last file downloaded from the ftp-server


Running

I suppose dcm is located in your home directory.

-Terminal:
	/home/username/d-cm/dcm &	(the & sign is optional)
-Nautilus:
	- goto /home/username/d-cm
	- doubleclick on dcm
	- choose run


Features

-File Manager
	The file Manager has 2 parts
	the left part is to navigate trough your directories, by doubleclicking the selected file will appear in the right window
	or if it is a folder (indicated with [F]) it will display the folder contents on the left.
	the right part is to control a file.
	You can Rename/Chmod/Edit and Open files
	Edit will show the file in deditor
	DOPEN will open the file with the default program in extlib.ded (this can be modified with the Extlib Manager)

-MySql
	This tab, is to control your Databases.  (DCM currently only supports MySql databases)
	After specifying your host,user and password in the configuration window (DCM->Options->Mysql) and starting mysql (MySql->Start)
	you will see on the left a list with all your tables and on the right, a box to enter queries, and an output box

-Deditor
	This is a basic editor which can do simple tasks and upload it's content to the web trough ftp.
	There is also a standalone version of deditor included in the D-CM-package.

-Ftp
	This works the same way as the file manager except it uses a ftp dir.

-Dcmd
	This is a program that is only available from terminal.
	the possible commands:
	dcmd -s		simply returns: 'DCM is running' or 'DCM is not running'
	dcmd -e		returns the ammount of rules in DOPEN/extlib.ded
	dcmd -u		Update/Upgrade the extlib package

-Dcmsvn
	This program is used for contributors that use svn.
	(it will not be included in a standard release, but you can download it in the downloads tab or with svn)
	Commands:
	dcmsvn -s		is the equal of svn status
	dcmsvn -c		is the equal of svn commit, but asks for the commit information instead of using the "-m 'commit info'" command
	dcmsvn -S		Synchronizes with the project repository on google code.  Asks for username before synching.
	TIP:dcmsvn -cS	Commit your info and directly Synchronize in one command

-Derminal
	this is a "terminal" integrated in D-CM. it is not a real copy of a terminal, to use this do: DCM->Terminal Window      in the menubar,this will open gnome-terminal with the current 	directory in the filemanager.
	Derminal instead is used to do a single command, so everytime you do a command a new terminal is used.
	This is very import because if you want to do "cd" and then "ls" you will have to do:
	"cd ~/.../... && ls" <- in one line and not first cd and then ls
