# D-CM #
## D-Control Manager ##
### For Who? ###
DCM is written in python and is a manager specially developed for web-programmers.
### Why? ###
As a web-programmer you quickly have a lot of programs running<br>
A sql-manager, terminal, a browser, Nautilus/Konqueror/..., ftp-manager, ...<br>
D-CM solves this problem, now you only need d-cm and a browser and your off =)<br>
It will even be possible to only use your browser in the future! ;)<br>
